# GoController

Gocontroller is a library for using a web browser as a controller for games and applications. It uses Go to host a gamepad webpage locally, which can be used by multiple devices simultaneously to play games and/or send keys. Gocontroller can be used for:

- Writing Go-SDL games with mobile controller support.
- As a substitute for physical controllers for local multiplayer games and emulators
- Controlling applications on the RaspberryPi
- With custom gamepads it could be adapted to multiplayer simulation games
